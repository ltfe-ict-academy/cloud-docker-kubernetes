So you can’t drop all capabilities if you do that.\n",

You won’t be able to bind to ports <1024, but that’s a good thing—that’s another capability (CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE) you don’t need. And since your container is pretty much always behind a proxy of some sort, that’s fine, the external proxy can listen on port 443 for you.\n",
